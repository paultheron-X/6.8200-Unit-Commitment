This is the course project for 6.8200 Computational Sensorimotor Learning. The course is taught by [Prof. Pulkit Agrawam]().

## Project Description
In that project, we explore the unit commitment problem, which is a combinatorial optimization problem that aims to find the optimal set of generators to be turned on and off in order to meet the demand of the system while minimizing the cost of the system, using reinforcement learning.
### Environment

Our work will use the environment provided by the [RL4UC](https://github.com/pwdemars/rl4uc). The environment is using the gym open ai interface.

## Environment

To create the environment, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash

conda create -n sensorimotor_env python=3.9

conda activate sensorimotor_env
```

To install the required packages, run the following command

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
